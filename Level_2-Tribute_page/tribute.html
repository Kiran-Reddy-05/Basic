            In addition to his leadership, Dhoni is revered for his incredible wicketkeeping and finishing abilities in limited-overs cricket. His astute decision-making, especially during the closing stages of a game, has earned him the reputation of being one of the finest finishers in the sport's history. His unorthodox helicopter shot is iconic and a testament to his innovative batting style.
